1. Comments throughout the entire project pointing out where each requirement 
	was met. (10 points)

2. For, while, do/while, and enhanced for loops should be used to keep the 
	project running until the user wishes to end. At least 3 of the loops 
	mentioned should be used. (15 points) X

3. All values used in the program should be stored in variables. Whether value 
	is local or class level, there should be variables used with no 
	"literal" values. (10 points)

4. Methods: In addition to the main method there should be at least 3 other 
	methods in the main class. These methods need to receive AND 
	return values. (15 points) X

5. Classes: There should be at least least 1 other class in your project with
	 a minimum of 3 attributes, 3 behaviors, and at least 1 overloaded 
	 constructor and the default constructor. Objects of the class should 
	 be used in the application. (20 points) X

6. Arrays: You need to use at least a single dimensional array and a multi
	 dimensional array somewhere in the application. There must also be an 
	 array that stores a collection of one of the classes you create. 
	 (15 points) X

7. Selections: If/else AND switch statements should be used somewhere in
	 the application. (10 points) X

8. There must be a static variable used somewhere. (10 points) X

9. Design: The project cannot be just a demonstration of all of the items 
	mentioned here. It must be a well thought out application that makes sense,
	and each requirement is implemented in a logical way to compliment that 
	design. (25 points) 

10. Variables, Classes, and Methods use the proper casing 
	- camelCase, UpperCamelCase, ALLUPPER... (10 points)

11. Exception handling should be used to prevent your computer from 
	crashing. (10 points)
